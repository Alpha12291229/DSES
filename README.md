## Background ##

The ongoing pandemic has brought the flight traffics of many countries to a standstill. However, it is during this respite that airlines can reflect, based on past feedback obtained from their passengers, what are the factors that contribute to customer satisfaction. This is the case for Airline X. They collected data from their past passengers and would like to find out if good service was provided in terms of ease of online booking, seat comfort, check-in experience, cleanliness, baggage handling, etc., and the overall satisfaction level. Finding out the areas where they fell short of and harnessing their existing strengths, Airline X hopes to serve their customers to the best in time to come and be the choice airline. 

## The Problem Statement ##

Airline X wants to understand how the profiles of the passengers and their ratings of different services could possibly affect the overall satisfaction level. The airline also wishes to identify their strengths and areas of focus. 

You are part of the Data Science team to assist Airline X. Follow the steps of the Data Science Life Cycle to build predictive models to help increase the customer satisfaction level. 


## Task 1: Business & Data Understanding using EDA ##
- Explain five key takeaways (patterns, distributions, comparisons, categorising etc) from your understanding of data from the attributes with the help of visualisations.

## Task 2: Data Preparation ##
- Perform data cleaning to address the data quality issues found in the dataset. 
-	Explain or justify how you handled them.
-	Perform at least two transformation of data with proper explanations (e.g. convert numerical to categorical attribute, scaling, etc.)
-	Perform at least one method, including correlation analysis to review and select the best features for Data Modelling. 


## Task 3: Data Modelling ##
-	Perform regression(s) â€“ predict the independent attribute/target with the help of the information contained in the other attributes.
    - Should we use all attributes or CAN we use all attributes?
    - Justify why this regression method is used, why the selected attributes are appropriate for predicting the target. 
    - Show the equation of the model and explain its significance. 
    - Are you satisfied with the performance of the model(s)?
-	Perform k-means clustering to identify the different clusters of passengers within the data.
    - Should we use all attributes or CAN we use all attributes?
    - Justify why the selected attributes and parameters are used. 
    - Identify the different clusters.

## Task 4- Evaluations & Recommendations ##
-	Suggest 2 recommendations on how to improve customer satisfaction with the airline based on your analysis and modelling. Show evidences to support.
